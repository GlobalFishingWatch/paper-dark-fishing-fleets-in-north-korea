## Study area and claimed eez
Refer to the python notebook: `study_area_and_claimed_eez.ipynb` 
This notebook provides the code that creates Fig.S1 in the supplementary materials of the paper. The figure shows the claimed EEZ of North Korea, sea boundaries for the claimed military zone, and the overlapping claims between Russia and North Korea. It also illustrates the study area that we described in the supplementary materials.
